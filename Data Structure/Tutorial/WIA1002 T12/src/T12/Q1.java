     * List: 3 8 12 34 54 85 61 110
     * To search 45 in the list, linear search requires to compare every element in the list 
     * and return -1 whereas binary search requires to compare 3 elements in the list and less
     * iterations to return -1 in the list.
     * 
     * To search 54 in the list, linear search requires to compare 5 elements in the list to find 
     * the key whereas binary search requires to compare 3 elements in the list and less iterations
     * to find the key in the list.
     * 
     * In short, binary search is more effective than linear search.
