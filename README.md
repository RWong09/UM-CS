Hi! My name is Wong Hoong Liang. 
I am a Year 2 student from Universiti Malaya, studying Bachelor of Computer Science with a major in Data Science.
I have studied some coding and also data structure in my first year, and I am currently still learning Data Science which required some knowledge of coding, statistics and also analytics.
I have learnt some languages like Java, C++, Python and HTML. But I am still weak in coding lol :)

Anyways, I have some codes uploaded in this hub that I made, hope you all like it, and have fun learning computer science and data science hehe
